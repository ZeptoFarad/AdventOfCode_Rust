## Advent of Code in Rust ðŸ¦€

This repository is my attempt to complete the Advent of Code problems in Rust. I am doing this in order to get better at writing Rust.

- Code is probably not the most efficient solution
- Input text for the solutions has been removed as this is a requirement of AoC
- This is just for fun

---

If you would like to run these solutions you will need the Rust language installed:

**Windows**

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

**Linux**

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

---

After Rust is installed you will need to add the Advent of Code text from their site for the solution you are trying to run.
I have added this tag to the part of the code where the path for the input.txt file needs to be added:

`[--- Input File ---]`

---

When you have added the input.txt file you can run the solution file to print the solution to console:

`$ cargo run`
